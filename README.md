### Assignment overview

For this assignment, we queried the [Weather API] (https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) to answer a series of questions about current, forecasted and historical weather in different locations.
In the process of completing the assignment I learned the skill of exploring the data structures in order to find the information required.
Similarly, I also found the process of exploring the data quite challenging and spent a considerate amound of time trying to understand the structure in the browser.
